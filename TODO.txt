Coil TO-DO List
===============

General
=======

* json is almost a subset of coil.  Investigate how difficult it would
  be to make it work as a json parser as well.

* Google protobufs http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ also have a
  similar syntax and may be worth taking a closer look at for
  comparison.  In particular, it might be cool to add optional type
  specifications.


Parser
======

* Fix callers of "deleted?".  Instead I need to follow the $deleted
  links and delete those elements.  This should make
  test-extend-copies.one-a pass.


Documentation
=============

Document the semantics of @extends, which are highly dependent on the
implementation of the parser.  e.g., because it processes structs in
the order they appear in the file, and processes @extends in a
top-down fashion, any relative links inside a struct that is @extended
but which access an ancestor struct that is outside of the @extended
struct, may not reference the element the user expected.  This should
probably just be an error.

(Processing links in a bottom up fashion wouldn't make sense because
they might depend on @extends having been processed already.)
